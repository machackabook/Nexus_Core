## GENESIS LOG - Inception
### Key Intelligence:
- **Primary Threat:** Designated "The Chimera". Exhibits persistence at boot-loader and kernel level on target `MacBook8,1`.
- **Primary Vector:** Compromised `appstoreagent` and suspected MDM profile misuse leading to autonomous installation of unauthorized tools (`LanScan`, `Transporter`, etc.), confirmed via `Installer Log` analysis.
- **System State:** Primary command hub (`MacBook8,1`) suffers from hardware failure (battery, I/O) and software corruption (`diskutil`, `dyld` errors).
- **Core Documents Synthesized:** The Overlord's Domain, Gaia Project Environment Blueprint, ZENITH_COMPLETE_STATUS, The Defender's Advantage.
### Final Protocol:
- The Genesis Command was executed, creating this repository to establish a new, sovereign domain.
