# Enhanced Screener & Research System

## Overview

The Enhanced Screener & Research System provides comprehensive security monitoring, intrusion detection, and advanced research capabilities. This system integrates IBM Watson for quantum security research with real-time threat detection and quarantine functionality.

## Key Components

### 1. Enhanced Screener System

The Enhanced Screener monitors terminal sessions and commands in real-time, detecting potential security threats and quarantining suspicious files.

**Features:**
- Live intrusion detection with metadata tracking (who, where, when, what, why)
- Quarantine partition with "spaceport" emergency eject capability
- Extensive threat database with 100+ malicious command patterns
- Continuous monitoring of processes, network connections, and file system changes
- Integration with NEO RED security system for high-severity alerts

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start the enhanced screener
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/enhanced_screener.sh

# Emergency eject of quarantine partition
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/enhanced_screener.sh eject

# Update threat database
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/enhanced_screener.sh update
```

### 2. IBM Watson Research Interface

The IBM Watson CLI provides a quantum security research interface for analyzing malware, network intrusions, and quantum computing security implications.

**Features:**
- Interactive research mode with topic selection
- Detailed research results on security topics
- Integration with the screener system for threat analysis
- Specialized research on malware, quantum security, and network intrusions

**Usage:**
```bash
# Start interactive research mode
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/ibm_watson_cli.sh

# Research a specific topic
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/ibm_watson_cli.sh research malware
```

### 3. 3-Window Research Environment

The 3-window research environment provides a tiled layout with IBM Watson Research, Enhanced Screener, Gemini, and Amazon Q.

**Features:**
- IBM Watson Research on the top left
- Enhanced Screener on the bottom left
- Gemini on the top right
- Amazon Q on the bottom right
- Chrome integration for Gemini on second display

**Usage:**
```bash
# Launch the 3-window research environment
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/launch_3window_research.sh

# Launch with Chrome integration on second display
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/launch_3window_research.sh --with-chrome
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

The Enhanced Screener & Research System integrates with:

1. **NEO RED Security System** - For high-severity alerts and security response
2. **GemGem Enhanced Interface** - For AI-assisted analysis
3. **Amazon Q** - For AWS-specific security guidance
4. **Chrome/Gemini** - For web-based research and analysis

## Security Features

- **Live Intrusion Detection**: Monitors commands and processes in real-time
- **Quarantine System**: Isolates suspicious files in a secure partition
- **Emergency Eject**: "Spaceport" functionality for immediate threat containment
- **Threat Database**: Extensive database of malicious command patterns
- **Cross-Terminal Monitoring**: Tracks activity across multiple terminal sessions

## Getting Started

1. Launch the 3-window research environment:
   ```bash
   ~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/launch_3window_research.sh
   ```

2. Start researching security topics with IBM Watson:
   ```
   watson> research malware
   ```

3. Monitor for security threats with the Enhanced Screener:
   ```
   # Commands will be automatically monitored
   ```

4. Use Gemini and Amazon Q for additional analysis and guidance.

## Future Enhancements

- Automated threat hunting based on research findings
- Machine learning for pattern recognition in command sequences
- Integration with external threat intelligence feeds
- Quantum-resistant cryptography implementation
- Advanced visualization of security events
