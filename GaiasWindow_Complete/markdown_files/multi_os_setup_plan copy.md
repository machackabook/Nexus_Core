# Multi-OS Environment Setup Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the creation of a multi-OS environment on a MacBook (MacBook8,1) to run different AI models natively without virtualization. The setup will include:

1. **macOS (Current + Upgrade)**: Current macOS 11 with potential upgrade to macOS 12/13 via OpenCore
2. **Windows 10**: For running Copilot and Windows-specific AI models
3. **ChromeOS Flex**: Minimal installation for Gemini's environment and Google services

## Space Allocation (85GB Total)
- **Windows 10**: 50GB
  - Base OS: 30GB
  - AI models and applications: 15GB
  - Shared workspace: 5GB
  
- **ChromeOS Flex**: 20GB
  - Base OS: 15GB
  - Gemini environment: 3GB
  - Shared workspace: 2GB
  
- **Shared File System**: 15GB
  - Cross-platform scripts: 5GB
  - AI model data: 5GB
  - Recovery tools: 5GB

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Preparation
1. Create a comprehensive backup of the current system
2. Set up the shared file system structure
3. Prepare installation media for Windows 10 and ChromeOS Flex

### Phase 2: Partition and File System Setup
1. Resize the current APFS container to free up 85GB
2. Create new partitions:
   - 50GB NTFS partition for Windows 10
   - 20GB ext4 partition for ChromeOS Flex
   - 15GB exFAT partition for shared file system

### Phase 3: OS Installations
1. Install Windows 10 with necessary drivers
2. Install ChromeOS Flex with minimal configuration
3. Configure OpenCore for potential macOS upgrade

### Phase 4: Cross-OS Integration
1. Set up shared file system access from all OSes
2. Create cross-platform scripts with appropriate extensions
3. Configure boot manager for easy OS selection

### Phase 5: AI Environment Setup
1. Configure each OS for its specific AI model
2. Set up CLI interfaces for cross-OS control
3. Implement startup scripts for each environment

## Technical Considerations

### File System Compatibility
- **exFAT**: Primary shared partition accessible by all OSes
- **Symbolic Links**: Create links from each OS to the shared partition
- **Script Extensions**: Use .sh (macOS/ChromeOS) and .bat/.ps1 (Windows) with parallel implementations

### Boot Management
- **OpenCore**: Will handle macOS boot and OS selection
- **rEFInd**: Alternative boot manager if OpenCore proves problematic

### Cross-OS Communication
- **Network Shares**: For larger file transfers between OSes
- **REST APIs**: For inter-OS communication and control
- **Shared Scripts**: With OS-specific implementations for common tasks

### Recovery Mechanisms
- **Recovery Partitions**: Preserved for each OS
- **Cross-OS Recovery Tools**: Scripts to fix boot issues from any OS
- **External Recovery**: USB-based recovery option as backup

## Implementation Roadmap

### Immediate Steps
1. Create comprehensive backup
2. Resize APFS container
3. Create shared partition structure

### Short-term Goals
1. Windows 10 installation and configuration
2. Shared file system setup
3. Basic cross-OS scripts

### Medium-term Goals
1. ChromeOS Flex installation
2. AI model setup on each platform
3. Boot manager configuration

### Long-term Goals
1. Potential macOS upgrade via OpenCore
2. Advanced cross-OS integration
3. Optimization of AI environments

## Risk Mitigation
- Regular backups of all environments
- Testing of cross-OS scripts in controlled environments
- Maintaining recovery options for each OS
- Documentation of all configuration changes
