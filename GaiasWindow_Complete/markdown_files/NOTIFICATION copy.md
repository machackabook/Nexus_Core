# IMPORTANT SECURITY UPDATE
**Date:** 2025-06-02 22:58:27

SECURITY UPDATE: New USB security measures have been implemented to protect against malware.

A multi-stage quarantine system has been created for files coming from USB connections:
1. Files are intercepted and diverted to a mountable/ejectable partition
2. Files are processed through the trash bin for initial isolation
3. Files can be moved to a locked folder on desktop for analysis
4. Final stage uses Guest profile for complete isolation (auto-deletion on logout)

This system prevents malware from entering the main system and provides a secure way to handle files from USB devices.

## Actions Required
1. Run the USB tether autofix script before connecting to HP devices
2. Use the quarantine system for all USB file transfers
3. Update your workflow to include the new security measures

## New Scripts Available
- `usb_tether_autofix.sh`: Fixes USB tethering connection issues
- `usb_quarantine_system.sh`: Creates secure quarantine for USB files
- `usb_downlink_monitor.sh`: Monitors and intercepts files from USB connections

## How to Use
```bash
# Fix USB tethering issues
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/usb_tether_autofix.sh connect [username]

# Set up quarantine system
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/usb_quarantine_system.sh setup

# Set up flow diversion
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/usb_downlink_monitor.sh setup
```
