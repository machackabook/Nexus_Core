# AI Autonomous Environment Project Plan

## Core Objectives
- Create a self-sustaining AI environment with redundant systems
- Enable cross-device operation (macOS to Windows)
- Implement resilient power management and recovery mechanisms
- Establish interoperability between multiple AI instances
- Develop a VIM-like partitioned workspace for parallel AI operations

## Resource Allocation
- Total allocation: 10-20GB
- Primary storage: Local disk
- Secondary storage: Cloud-based repositories
- Tertiary storage: Cross-device shared storage

## System Architecture

### Layer 1: Core Infrastructure
- Containerization system (Docker)
- Cross-platform communication protocols
- Redundant storage management
- Power management and monitoring

### Layer 2: AI Operation Environment
- Language model runtime environments
- Knowledge bases and vector stores
- Tool libraries and API connectors
- Interprocess communication framework

### Layer 3: Resilience Systems
- Automated backup and recovery
- State preservation mechanisms
- Cross-device synchronization
- Fault detection and remediation

### Layer 4: Expansion Capabilities
- USB-to-USB cross-device bridge
- Network sharing and hotspot management
- Resource optimization for metered connections
- Distributed computing framework

## Implementation Phases
1. Core infrastructure setup
2. Tool acquisition and organization
3. Resilience system implementation
4. Cross-device bridge development
5. Full system integration and testing
