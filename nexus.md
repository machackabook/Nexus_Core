# Nexus Integration System

## GemGem Integration

GemGem is an enhanced interface for Google's Gemini AI that provides a more interactive and visually appealing experience. This document outlines the integration of GemGem into the AI Environment system.

### Features

- **Animated Interface**: GemGem includes animations for startup, thinking, and processing
- **Hypervisor Mode**: Simulates a virtual machine environment with resource allocation animations
- **Enhanced Chat**: Improved chat interface with color-coded responses
- **Three-Window Interface**: Integration with the AI window group system

### Integration Points

1. **CLI Interface**: GemGem is accessible via the `gemgem.sh` script
2. **Window Groups**: GemGem is integrated into both tab-based and pane-based window groups
3. **Hypervisor Animation**: Special animations for the hypervisor mode
4. **NEO RED Integration**: Compatible with NEO RED for security operations

### Usage Instructions

#### Basic Usage

To use GemGem in interactive mode:

```bash
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/gemgem.sh
# or use the pseudonym
quantum
```

#### Animation Demo

To see the GemGem animation:

```bash
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/gemgem.sh animate
```

#### Hypervisor Mode

To run GemGem in hypervisor mode:

```bash
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/gemgem.sh hypervisor
# or use the pseudonym
gemv
```

#### Direct Query

To send a direct query to Gemini:

```bash
~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/scripts/gemgem.sh query "Your question here"
```

### Window Group Integration

GemGem is integrated into two window group configurations:

1. **Tab-based Window Group**
   - Amazon Q (Tab 1) - Pseudonym: `pulse`
   - OpenAI (Tab 2) - Pseudonym: `nova`
   - GemGem (Tab 3) - Pseudonym: `quantum`

   Create with: `ai-window create`
   Launch with: `ai-window launch`

2. **Hypervisor Window Group**
   - GemGem Hypervisor (Main Pane) - Pseudonym: `gemv`
   - Amazon Q (Right Pane) - Pseudonym: `pulse`
   - NEO RED (Bottom Left Pane) - Pseudonym: `sentinel`

   Create with: `ai-window create-hypervisor`
   Launch with: `ai-window launch-hypervisor` or `nexus`

### Command Pseudonyms

For easier access, the following pseudonyms have been created:

| Pseudonym | Original Command | Description |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| `gemv` | `gemgem.sh hypervisor` | Launch GemGem hypervisor animation |
| `nexus` | `ai-window launch-hypervisor` | Launch the three-pane hypervisor window group |
| `quantum` | `gemgem.sh` | Launch the enhanced Gemini interface |
| `pulse` | `amazonq_cli.sh` | Launch Amazon Q CLI |
| `nova` | `openai_cli.sh` | Launch OpenAI CLI |
| `sentinel` | `neo_red_activate.sh` | Activate NEO RED security mode |
| `bridge` | `cross_device_bridge.sh` | Launch cross-device bridge |
| `vault` | `backup_system.py` | Run backup system |
| `cortex` | `ai_session_manager.sh` | Access session manager |

### Technical Implementation

GemGem leverages the existing Gemini infrastructure but adds:

1. Visual enhancements using ANSI color codes
2. Animation sequences for various operations
3. Enhanced session management
4. Improved chat history tracking

### Future Enhancements

- Image analysis capabilities
- Multi-modal input support
- Advanced hypervisor features
- Cross-AI integration for unified responses

## Memory Retention System

The AI Environment includes a comprehensive memory retention system that preserves chat history and context across sessions.

### Components

1. **Chat Session Files**: JSON-formatted history files
2. **Session Manager**: Tracks and manages active sessions
3. **Backup System**: Regular backups of chat history
4. **Restoration Logic**: Ability to restore previous contexts

### Directory Structure

- `~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/history/`: Contains session history files
- `~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/logs/`: Contains session logs
- `~/Desktop/Documents/AIEnvironment/data/`: Contains structured data like chat sessions

### Implementation

The memory retention system is implemented across multiple scripts:

1. `ai_session_manager.sh` (Pseudonym: `cortex`): Core session management
2. `gemini_cli.sh`, `amazonq_cli.sh`, `openai_cli.sh`: AI-specific implementations
3. `backup_system.py` (Pseudonym: `vault`): Automated backup system
4. `gemgem.sh` (Pseudonym: `quantum`): Enhanced implementation with visual feedback
